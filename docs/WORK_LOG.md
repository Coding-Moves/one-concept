# Work log

Keep durable working agreements in [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and the source
navigation guide in [CODEBASE_MAP.md](CODEBASE_MAP.md). This file records current
work and handoffs. Do not store credentials, raw private data, or speculative
claims as completed work.

## Current status

- Assigned scope: only [#133](https://github.com/Coding-Moves/one-concept/issues/133).
  Confirm the problems first, then open one PR into `develop` for offline reading,
  personalization persistence, and automatic action synchronization.
- Branch: `codex/133-offline-reading-sync`, based on refreshed `origin/develop`
  at `89a8fb8`. The starting tree matches the tested baseline.
- Release #179 and card follow-up #180 are merged; #181 synchronized `main`
  back into `develop`. This task does not authorize another production release.

## Offline reading and synchronization (#133) — 2026-09-12

- Before editing, exported the unchanged web app and exercised it in Chromium
  with dummy authentication and intercepted API requests. No live account used.
- Confirmed: a custom saved concept opened online loses its full text after an
  offline restart; a warmed topic catalog is unavailable after offline restart;
  offline topic changes do not enter the persistent queue; restoring connectivity
  alone leaves an offline like queued without sending a request.
- Passing controls: saved detail online, cached Today offline, and durable offline
  like queuing. Preserve those existing behaviors and the offline banner.
- Planned atomic commits: persistent full-concept reading with account cleanup
  and tests; cached topic catalog and queued follows with tests; automatic sync
  triggers with tests; validation, codebase map, and PR handoff.
- Clarification pending: keep the current APK with sync while open/reopened, or
  add native OS background scheduling (new APK, OS-controlled execution timing).
- Read the exact Expo SDK 57 documentation before mobile edits. Other issues,
  including #182's password-visibility request, remain outside this PR.

## Working agreement — 2026-09-11

Work in chunks delivered through PRs. Every small, meaningful change gets its
own commit, and the PR retains all commits for that chunk. Prefer the maximum
useful granularity, without empty commits or artificially broken changes.
No numeric commit cap was specified. Preserve history instead of squashing it.

Authorship follow-up: the owner requests credit for their work with no Codex
co-author or AI attribution. The configured Git identity is `Muawiya Amir`;
the setup commits use that identity for author and committer, with no co-author
trailers. Preserve the configured owner identity for future work.

The agent handles planning, implementation, review, and bookkeeping. These are
responsibilities, not a request to launch additional agents.

## Setup record — 2026-09-11

### Starting point

- Clean working tree on `docs/source-available-policy` at `ba67edf`.
- Cached `origin/develop` is `5a2f957`, which includes that branch's changes.
  Its tree matches the inspected checkout. Local `develop` is older.
- Repository refs were inspected locally; remote branch state was not refreshed.
- Existing `mobile/AGENTS.md` and `mobile/CLAUDE.md` are preserved.

### Changes and commit ledger

| Change | Commit |
| --- | --- |
| Root instructions, PR/commit rules, responsibilities, validation guidance | `25c7540` — `docs: define agent workflow and granular commit rules` |
| Codebase map covering mobile, backend, schema, tests, and operations | `f6aec01` — `docs: map application architecture and development paths` |
| Durable setup record, validation baseline, and future chunk template | `fb5ccdb` — `docs: initialize project work log` |
| Owner authorship and no AI attribution rule | `5a25b7e` — `docs: record owner authorship and no AI attribution` |
| Setup PR link and publication handoff | `4cc1a68` — `docs: record setup pull request` |

### Exploration and decisions

- Inspected the tracked structure, application entry points, API/service/state
  boundaries, screens and components, auth and offline paths, schema/migrations,
  test coverage, dependency/configuration files, release docs, and workflows.
- Captured source-based documentation drift in `CODEBASE_MAP.md`; no feature,
  bug-fix, dependency, migration, or release work is part of this setup chunk.
- Root `AGENTS.md` holds shared rules; the existing mobile file retains its
  specialized Expo requirement. This follows the documented
  [AGENTS.md layering model](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/agents-md).

### Validation baseline

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run typecheck` in `mobile/` | Passed (`tsc --noEmit`). |
| `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -rs` in `backend/` with dummy DB/Auth environment overrides and live generation disabled | 27 passed, 66 skipped; no test failures. |
| PostgreSQL integration tests | Not exercised: Podman cannot create `/run/user/1000/libpod` in this sandbox (read-only filesystem). Skips are not passing integration coverage. |
| Documentation links, scope, and whitespace | Local links verified; changes limited to these three Markdown files; whitespace checks passed. |

No deployed API, physical device, push delivery, native build, or production
database was tested. The files changed in this chunk are documentation only.

### PR publication — 2026-09-11

- Refreshed `origin/develop` and checked the complete branch diff before pushing.
- Opened [PR #176](https://github.com/Coding-Moves/one-concept/pull/176) from
  `codex/project-bookkeeping` into `develop` using the owner's `Muawiya-contact`
  GitHub account. All four original setup commits are preserved.
- Added this bookkeeping update as a separate follow-up commit. The PR records
  the existing validation baseline and its PostgreSQL integration-test limitation.

### Next step

The setup PR was subsequently merged. The owner's next task is recorded below.

## Bot PR review — 2026-09-12

The owner requested individual review, approval, and merging of all open bot PRs.
The initial inventory contained #172, #173, and #174, all targeting `develop`.
No PR CI checks were attached, so validation used an isolated checkout with
dummy public configuration and no live backend or production credentials.

| PR | Finding and disposition |
| --- | --- |
| [#172 — React DOM 19.2.8](https://github.com/Coding-Moves/one-concept/pull/172) | Standalone `npm ci` failed with ERESOLVE because React remained 19.2.3. Initial changes-requested review recorded. Resolved by incorporating #173 so React and React DOM update together. |
| [#173 — React 19.2.8](https://github.com/Coding-Moves/one-concept/pull/173) | Standalone renderer smoke check threw an exact-version mismatch with React DOM 19.2.3. Initial changes-requested review recorded. Approval applies to the validated pair incorporated in #172, not a standalone merge. |
| [#174 — TypeScript 7.0.2](https://github.com/Coding-Moves/one-concept/pull/174) | Clean install, typecheck, and Android/web exports passed against current develop. Approved and merged as `71cf7fe`; its preview OTA workflow also passed. |

### React integration and validation

- Preserved both original dependency commits and refreshed current `develop`
  into the React DOM branch. Resolved adjacent manifest/lockfile edits by setting
  both React and React DOM to `19.2.8`; no other dependency changes were introduced.
- Dependabot rebased #173 during review. Rebuilt the pair using its updated head
  `195b48a` and verified that both package files were byte-identical to the tested
  candidate. Integration merge commit: `62d54cc`.
- Clean `npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund`, `npm run typecheck`, and
  server-renderer smoke test passed for the pair with TypeScript 7.0.2.
- Expo production exports for Android and web passed. The renderer smoke test
  returned `<div>One Concept</div>` with React and React DOM both at 19.2.8.
- Expo SDK 57's bundled recommendations still list React/React DOM 19.2.3;
  these are tested patch updates within the allowed Dependabot patch policy.
  A physical-device test was not performed. Native runtime and app version were
  unchanged; this is a dependency maintenance update, not a production release.
- Decision: approve each React PR in the context of the tested pair and merge
  #172 into `develop` once both heads are verified. #173's head is included in
  that integration, avoiding a broken intermediate preview OTA.
- Bookkeeping commit: `docs: record bot dependency reviews` (this commit).

### Handoff

Verify the GitHub merge states and resulting preview OTA, then notify the owner.
Use PR #172's live status for the final integrated result. No `develop` to `main`
release is included in this task.

## Offline UI recovery — 2026-09-12

- **Issues:** [#166](https://github.com/Coding-Moves/one-concept/issues/166)
  (animated offline empty pages) and
  [#167](https://github.com/Coding-Moves/one-concept/issues/167)
  (weak connections cause sign-in prompts and raw network errors).
- **Scope:** preserve cached browsing during session refresh; present friendly
  authentication errors; reuse an animated, accessible empty state with retry
  on unavailable content. Preserve useful cached content and real empty states.
- **Planned commits:** session recovery and regression coverage; friendly auth
  transport/error handling; shared offline illustration; integrate screen retry
  states; record validation and PR handoff. Keep each meaningful change atomic.
- **Research:** read Expo SDK 57 docs, React Native Animated/AccessibilityInfo
  docs, and the installed Supabase refresh/storage implementation. Use built-in
  animation with reduced-motion support; no asset download or native dependency.
- **Release boundary:** keep app/runtime versions unchanged in this chunk. The
  later release preparation selects the version and includes a matching one-time
  What's New entry only for new features, per `RELEASING.md`.
- **Commits:** `db1c59e` records scope; `4bed52a` restores cached sessions;
  `53f2e1a` adds safe auth messages and bounded requests; `67643d6` adds the
  reusable animation; `22fbcef` integrates retry and offline states on six screens.
- **Validation:** clean dependency install, 10 Node regression tests,
  TypeScript checks, and Android/web production exports passed. Browser checks
  used dummy accounts and intercepted requests: expired-session cached browsing
  and offline states in Today, History, Saved, Stats, and Personalization were
  verified, including the light-theme layout and successful topic retry.
  No live backend, physical device, or native release was tested.
- **Documentation:** updated the codebase map and test instructions. Bookkeeping
  and handoff are recorded in `docs: record offline UI validation and handoff`.
- **Next step:** owner reviews and merges this PR into `develop`, then prepares
  the version bump/eligible What's New entry and opens the release PR.

## Version 1.7.1 preparation — 2026-09-12

- **Scope:** the owner approved preparing the patch version and opening the
  release PR. Keep native runtime `1.3.0`; only JavaScript, dependencies, and
  documentation changed since `1.7.0`.
- **Planned commits:** marketing version bump; release bookkeeping and map update.
- **What's New:** no `1.7.1` entry. This maintenance release contains offline
  fixes and UI improvements; the features-only card policy excludes those.
- **Migrations:** no differences between `main` and `develop`; all nine existing
  filenames are recorded in the applied ledger. No production schema writes are needed.
- **Validation:** version/runtime assertions, migration diff/ledger check,
  10 regression tests, TypeScript, and whitespace checks passed. The merged
  application already passed Android/web exports and browser recovery checks
  in #177, followed by successful preview OTA on `f14a614`.
- **Commits:** `56e92fc` bumps the version; `docs: record 1.7.1 release preparation`
  updates this log and the codebase map. GitHub PRs record final merge/check state.
- **PRs:** version preparation and release PR publication follow these checks.
- **Handoff:** open the release PR after the preparation PR merges; do not merge
  `main` or trigger production publication as part of this task.

## Version 1.7.1 card follow-up — 2026-09-12

- The owner explicitly requested a one-time card for this release after learning
  that the maintenance-only entry had been omitted, then made this a standing
  rule: every release PR includes the card automatically, focused on new features
  and user-visible improvements rather than errors or technical diagnostics.
- Saved the standing rule in root `AGENTS.md`, `RELEASING.md`, and the release
  data's content-policy comment. It supersedes the earlier features-only rule.
- Add three concise highlights in `mobile/src/data/whatsNew.ts` covering cached
  session recovery, animated offline screens with retry, and clear auth errors.
- Reuse the existing version-keyed card and dismissal storage: show after sign-in
  until dismissed, then keep it hidden for this version on the device.
- Commits: `654a3aa` adds the version entry; a separate policy/copy commit saves
  the owner's standing rule; final bookkeeping records validation and handoff.
- Deliver through a small PR into `develop`, then merge it so release PR #179
  includes the card. Production release remains open for owner approval.
- Validation: TypeScript and the web export passed. The browser check with a
  mocked account verified all three `1.7.1` highlights display, Got it persists
  dismissal, and reloading keeps the card hidden. No uncaught browser errors.
- Policy/copy commit: `e77f80e`. This validation and handoff are recorded in
  `docs: record release-card policy and dismissal verification`.
